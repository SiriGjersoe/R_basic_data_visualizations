* loading data frame *
* Some basic data visualizations in R studio
This data is from my linguistic field work *

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("subsetdataLexMidpointF0.csv", sep = ",")

```

# Q plot
* This quick plots shows the fundamental frequency of measured in the midpoint (y-axis) and onset of the vowel (x-axis) of six speakers.
```{r}
qplot(vowelOnsetF0, midpointF0, data = dat, color = Speaker)

```

# ggplot with some more specifications
```{r}
ggplot() + geom_point(data = dat, aes(x = vowelOnsetF0, y = midpointF0, shape = Speaker)) +
  ggtitle("Midpoint of fundamental frequency")
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
